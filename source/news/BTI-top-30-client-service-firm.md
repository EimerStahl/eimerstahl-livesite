Eimer Stahl is pleased to announce that it has been named one of just 30 top-performing law firms in the area of client service by BTI.  Each year, BTI recognizes an elite group of law firms based on client nominations for superior client services across 17 various criteria.  In selecting the top 30 firms, BTI interviewed approximately 240 corporate counsel at Fortune 1000 companies.  This year, Eimer Stahl is welcomed to that elite group ranking highly in all 17 of the client-focused activities.

BTI praised Eimer Stahl as a firm “regularly lauded for its Client Focus and ability to Understand the Client’s Business.”  Corporate counsel nominating Eimer Stahl commend the firm for its “excellent knowledge and a strong understanding of our business.”

Eimer Stahl is also a 2011 Leader of the Best in the category of Innovative Approach.  The firm made the Honor Roll of the Best in 16 other areas of client service including understanding the client’s business and anticipating the client’s needs.
