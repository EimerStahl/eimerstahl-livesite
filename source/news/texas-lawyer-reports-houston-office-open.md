On July, 7, 2008, Texas Lawyer reported:

Eimer Stahl Klevorn & Solberg, a Chicago-based litigation boutique, is the latest firm to set up an outpost in Houston. The firm, started by attorneys from Sidley Austin in 2000, plans to share an office with DeGuerin & Dickson, the firm led by Houston criminal-defense attorney Dick DeGuerin and Lewis Dickson. The firms will share space in DeGuerin's current downtown Houston office and work together on white-collar criminal cases, says Nate Eimer, one of the founders of the Chicago firm. For Eimer Stahl, this first office outside of Chicago will allow the firm to work more closely with a key client, U.S. oil refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp., and to develop additional refining and petrochemical litigation business, Eimer says. Eimer and DeGuerin teamed last year on an environmental criminal case the United States brought against Citgo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, United States v. Citgo. "We of course hope that combining our resources makes us both stronger," Eimer says. "It will give [Eimer Stahl] a way into the white-collar criminal market in Houston." It's a good arrangement for his firm, too, DeGuerin says. "They have a tremendous capability of handling these cases with millions of documents. I've done that before. But I've usually had to have another firm joint venture with me," says DeGuerin, whose strength is in trial work. "But here we can use the capabilities of both our firms." Catherine Baen, who also worked on the Citgo trial last year and who is currently working as a solo practitioner in DeGuerin's office, will join Eimer Stahl next month as of counsel, becoming one of the first attorneys for the firm based there. Eimer will lead the office and commute between Chicago and Houston. Eimer Stahl, which focuses on antitrust and other complex litigation, has 28 partners and associates in Chicago and also employs 20 contract attorneys mainly for document review, he says.
