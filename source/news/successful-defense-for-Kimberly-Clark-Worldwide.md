After an eight day jury trial in Snohomish County, Washington, on May 30, 2008 a 12-person jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Eimer Stahl client, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide.  In the litigation, United Wood Products Company, an Oregon corporation, sought to recover damages of $57 million (including lost profits) for an alleged wrongful termination of a fuel supply contract at Kimberly-Clark's Everett, Washington paper mill.  David Stahl and Jon Wier tried the case on behalf of Kimberly-Clark, assisted by legal assistant Omowale Amoin and summer associate Aaron Suh.
