The Legal Aid Bureau of Metropolitan Family Services has established The Scott C. Solberg Pro Bono Award to be given annually to a Chicago lawyer or law firm displaying a strong commitment to the fundamental principles of equal protection and equal justice in the community through outstanding pro bono service. The award is named after Scott Solberg, a founding partner of Eimer Stahl who has served as a board member and chair of the Legal Aid Society, and chair of the Societyâ€™s Pro Bono Committee.

This year, the Legal Aid Bureau presented the award to three law firms: Bryan Cave, DLA Piper, and Vedder Price.
