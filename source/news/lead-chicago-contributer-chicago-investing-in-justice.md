For the second year in a row, Eimer Stahl Klevorn & Solberg LLP was #1 in the Campaign both in the percentage of attorneys contributing and the amount of their total contributions on a pro rata basis.  The 2009 Investing in Justice Campaign raised nearly $1 million to support the communityâ€™s many outstanding pro bono and legal aid organizations and their dedicated attorneys.
