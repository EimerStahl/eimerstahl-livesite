Eimer Stahl announced last week the addition of four lawyers from Edwards Wildman Palmer: partners Michael McCluggage and Brent Austin, counsel John Street and associate John Seber.

"We are very pleased to add these outstanding lawyers to our litigation and antitrust practice as we strive to be the leading provider of such services in Chicago and on a national basis," says Nathan P Eimer, who co-founded the antitrust and business litigation boutique in 2000.

Eimer Stahl is headquartered in Chicago and has a Houston office. Eimer Stahl now totals 37 attorneys, 10 of whom are partners. The firm also snagged David Simon as counsel from his partnership at Edwards Wildman in October.

In 2011, Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge merged with Wildman Harrold Allen & Dixon, where McCluggage and Austin had been partners.

McCluggage is a 1972 graduate of the University of Chicago law school, and has served as a chairman of the American Bar Association section of antitrust law’s insurance industry committee. He has extensive experience in antitrust litigation, government investigations, internal investigations and counselling, with special expertise in the insurance industry.

McCluggage was counsel to CNA Financial, Continental Insurance, Continental Casualty and American Casualty in the In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation. Recently, he represented BPC Chicago and JSC Belarusian Potash in the potash class action litigation.

Austin was the co-chair of Edwards Wildman’s commercial litigation group and leader of the firm’s class action litigation practice. He has been frequently involved in multidistrict litigation defending insurance companies, and is the editor for the current revision of the American Bar Association’s Insurance Antitrust Handbook.

Austin graduated from the University of California-Berkeley School of Law in 1989, and worked at Wilson Sonsini and McDermott Will & Emery before becoming a partner at Edwards Wildman’s predecessor firm, Wildman Harrold.

Becket McGrath, the London-based head of Edwards Wildman’s competition practice, says, "I knew and worked with Mike and Brent. They are fine lawyers and we wish them well in their new firm."
