On September 30, 2009 the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed a judgment of a trial court dismissing claims that ComEdâ€™s recovery of so-called transition charges from electric service customers taking service from alternative suppliers violated the Illinois Constitution.  ESKS represented ComEd in both the trial court and the Appellate Court.  On November 3, a Petition for Leave to Appeal was filed with the Illinois Supreme Court.
