The best lawyers are often the busiest lawyers, but we managed to get a few minutes with six hot-shot Chicago attorneys to ask them a range of questions about themselves and about the state of the law today.

Nate Eimer, 55
*Eimer Stahl Klevorn & Solberg LLP*

Before starting his own firm four years ago, Nate Eimer was a partner at Chicago-based Sidley Austin brown & Wood LLP, where he was co-head of the firm's commercial and regulatory litigation practice group and also was head of the litigation practice in the firm's New York office.

**Big cases:** Mr. Eimer defends Conrad Black in Chicago Sun-Times publisher Hollinger International Inc.'s suit against its former CEO. Other clients of his include CITGO Petroleum Corp., Dow Chemical Co. and Citigroup.

**How has the law changed?** "Cases are much larger and there's a lot more money at risk."

**What makes you proud to be a lawyer? **"Seeing (Northwestern University law professor) Larry Marshall and others like him represent wrongfully convicted death row inmates and vindicate their innocence."
