**Eimer Stahl Klevorn & Solberg LLP**

**FIRM OVERVIEW:** Eimer Stahl Klevorn & Solberg LLP engages in complex litigation throughout the United States. The firm is dedicated to providing top quality legal services in a cost-effective manner. With a commitment to client service, advanced technology and diversity, the firm partners with clients to obtain creative solutions to complex legal problems. The firm is proud to serve as trial counsel to many leading companies and organizations.

**MAIN AREAS OF PRACTICE:** The firm concentrates on complex litigation across a variety of subject areas, including antitrust, environmental, securities, energy, unfair competition, product liability, toxic torts, construction, and general commercial disputes. The firm has particular expertise relating to the defense of class action lawsuits, particularly in the securities, mass tort and antitrust fields. Matters on which the firm has recently worked include government investigations and private suits relating to energy prices, defense of several securities class actions and related SEC investigations, defense of mass tort claims alleging injury arising from the use of fuel additives, multimillion dollar breach of contract claims in the paper and cement industries, and defense of price-fixing claims in the chemical, dairy, pharmaceutical, and paper industries. The firm also engages in antitrust counseling, including obtaining government antitrust clearance of proposed hergers and acquisitions. Members of the firm have provided good advice regarding such matters across a wide variety of industries, including consumer goods, paper, chemicals, commercial printing, cosmetics, telecommunications, crop nutrients and fertilizers, foodstuffs, and automotive parts.

Superior client service is a hallmark of the firm’s operating philosophy and principles.

**ANTITRUST**

**The Firm:** Commentators persistently endorsed the caliber of this firm’s antitrust professionals, claiming that “for a smaller group they are unmatched in the market.” The boutique practice is “one of the leaders” in Chicago, according to clients, a base from where it can mobilize resources to tackle complex cases across the country. Its investment in technology means the firm is well placed to handle multifaceted matters, but commentators note that it still retains the personal touch thanks to the attitude of its “enthusiastic and helpful” attorneys. The firm is known for its effective regulatory advice, antitrust litigation and strategic trial strength.

**The Lawyers:** That Nate Eimer was a driving force in founding and forging the identity of this firm is a “testament to his unique skills, abilities and confidence,” say peers. He continues to be a valuable ingredient in the firm’s success, due in part to his “compelling persona,” and is agreed to be “a skilled advocate with pronounced strategic sense.” An enviable client list includes Union Carbide, for which Eimer has acted as counsel on major multidistrict price-fixing cases. He also recently represented Bank of New York against United Airlines in matters arising from the airline’s bankruptcy proceedings. Clients championed Andrew Klevorn for his deep litigation experience and his “calm but compelling demeanor.” He has recently had a role working with Union Carbide in its claims against shipping companies alleging overcharging. Competitors acknowledge that David Stahl can “really try cases; he is extremely smart and adept in court.” He enjoys the kudos that 30 years’ experience in commercial and antitrust litigation can bring and has worked on a wide variety of matters from price-fixing and securities law violations to class actions and construction disputes.

**Clients/Work Highlights:** Dow Chemical; Corn Products International; Citigroup; Union Carbide; Land O’Lakes and AmerisourceBergen.
