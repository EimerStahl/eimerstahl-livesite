Susan M. Razzano is a trial lawyer with experience in complex product liability and consumer fraud litigation.  Prior to joining Eimer Stahl LLP in 2011, Ms. Razzano was an Associate at Sidley Austin LLP where she had worked since graduating law school in 2006.

Ms. Razzano has worked on both state and federal cases and has experience with both multidistrict litigation and class actions.  Relevant experience includes:

* *Clark v. LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc.* – class action litigation removed to federal court in the Northern District of California in which Plaintiffs alleged defective design of a refrigerator and asserted various consumer fraud claims against an electronics manufacturer.  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint was defeated on a Motion to Dismiss and a Second Amended Complaint has been filed.

* *New Hampshire v. Hess, et al.* – a multi-billion dollar litigation tried in New Hampshire state court in which Ms. Razzano represented a major oil refiner in a suit filed by the State alleging that an additive used in gasoline is defective and causes groundwater contamination.  The State brought suit based on an alleged state-wide injury, claiming that contamination in one portion of its groundwater results in contamination of all waters in the state.  The State also proceeded on a market share theory of liability, attempting to expand the use of market share beyond traditional DES personal injury cases.

* Temperature Adjusted Fuel Litigation – class action litigation pending in federal court in which Ms. Razzano represented a major oil refiner in a suit alleging deceptive and misleading practices and conspiracy to further the same in the sale of motor fuel to consumers.

* Omniscan litigation – involving over a hundred personal injury cases filed in state and federal courts around the country against a pharmaceutical manufacturer alleging negligence, strict liability, defective design, failure to warn, and breach of warranty.

* Seroquel litigation – multi-district litigation involving several hundred personal injury cases filed in state and federal courts nationwide against a pharmaceutical manufacturer alleging negligence, strict liability, defective design, failure to warn, and breach of warranty.

* Baycol litigation – multi-district litigation consolidating hundreds of personal injury cases filed in both state and federal courts around the country against a pharmaceutical manufacturer alleging negligence, strict liability, defective design, failure to warn, and breach of warranty.

* Orkin litigation – consumer fraud action in which plaintiffs sought to certify a class against a nationally known pest control company alleging damages due to inadequate termite treatment, failure to complete guaranteed annual inspections, and breach of warranty.

Ms. Razzano graduated cum laude from Northwestern University School of Law in 2006, where she was the Executive Articles Editor on the Northwestern University Law Review.  She received her undergraduate degree, cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, from Skidmore College in 1997.
