Scott Solberg is one of the founding partners of Eimer Stahl LLP. His practice involves complex commercial litigation and counseling across diverse subject matters, including antitrust, securities litigation, commercial torts, contracts and products liability. Representative cases that Scott has worked on include:

* Representing Union Carbide Corporation in a federal antitrust class action lawsuit brought by direct purchasers of plastics additives, including epoxidized soybean oil.  See In re Plastics Additives Antitrust Litigation, 2010 WL 3431837 (E.D. PA. Aug. 31, 2010)(denying class certification).

The jury found no permanent injury and awarded only nominal damages for temporary injuries that were conceded at trial.

* Defending Union Carbide Corporation against illegal dividend and unjust enrichment claims brought by its former subsidiary, Ucar Carbon Company, seeking in excess of $300 million in allegedly illegal dividends paid by the plaintiff to Union Carbide. See Ucar v. Union Carbide Corporation, 2004 WL 137073 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (dismissing all claims against Union Carbide).

* Representing various defendants, including Corn Products Corporation, Andersen LLP, and Hollinger Inc., in federal securities fraud class actions and related shareholder derivative lawsuits.
