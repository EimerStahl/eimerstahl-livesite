In October 2007, the Texas Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment in favor of firm client UOP LLC on nine separate causes of action brought by Orion Refining Corporation, which sought over $500 million in damages resulting from alleged defective technology sold by UOP to Orion.  Orion petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review, which initially denied Orionâ€™s petition.  Orion moved for rehearing, and after briefing by both parties that was requested by the court, the Texas Supreme Court denied the motion for rehearing in June 2008.  Nate Eimer and Vanessa Jacobsen represented UOP.
