David Stahl is one of the founding partners of Eimer Stahl LLP. He has practiced complex commercial litigation for nearly thirty years. David has had numerous bench and jury trials in state and federal court, as well as administrative proceedings, involving a wide variety of matters from attorney malpractice to construction disputes to antitrust claims to securities law violations to breach of contract cases to toxic torts. Some of the highlights of his practice include:

* Defense of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in a case alleging negligent supervision of construction and unreasonably low estimates of cost with respect to the John Hancock Center in Chicago.

* Representation of the Central and South West public utility holding company system in a series of cases at the United States Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Power (now Federal Energy Regulatory) Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the federal courts involving antitrust and other issues concerning the electrical interconnection of Texas with the power grid in the eastern portion of the United States.

* Defense of Dundee Cement Company (now Holcim Inc.), the largest cement producer in the United States, in a nationwide class action alleging horizontal price fixing by all domestic producers of cement. Dundee was the only defendant to obtain summary judgment on grounds of insufficient evidence that it participated in any "contract, combination or conspiracy."

* Representation of Commonwealth Edison Company in proceedings challenging ComEd's nuclear construction program, and in subsequent proceedings over recovery of costs associated with that construction program.

* Representation of Kimberly-Clark Corporation in several arbitrations (and related proceedings in bankruptcy court) with Mobile (Alabama) Energy Services Company, a subsidiary of the Southern Company, over continuing obligations under a power purchase agreement in the event of a mill closure.

* Defense of Kimberly-Clark Corporation in two separate lawsuits (a class action in Alabama and numerous individual suits in Maine) alleging personal injury, emotional distress and diminution in property value due to alleged exposure to "toxic" substances.

David graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1971. In 1973 he joined the firm of Isham, Lincoln & Beale, becoming a partner of that firm in 1979. He joined Sidley & Austin as a partner in 1988, leaving that firm in July 2000 to found Eimer Stahl LLP.
