## When we formed Eimer Stahl in 2000, we set out to create a different kind of litigation firm—one that would deliver outstanding results for clients, but take a more personal, creative approach to getting there. And that's what we've done.
Today, our firm has a solid track record of resolving the most complicated cases intelligently and efficiently. Our clients trust us to handle their most challenging legal problems—antitrust cases, class actions, multi-district environmental and product liability litigation, energy regulatory proceedings, securities litigation, and other high stakes commercial disputes.

## Our commitment to our clients drives us.
We get to know not just the facts relevant to a particular case, but practical aspects of each client's business, the challenges they face, and the goals they're targeting. We offer flexible and flat fee arrangements to control costs and share the risks of litigation. We work toward the long relationship rather than the long litigation. The results are tangible: more efficient, more cost-effective and more rewarding management of the litigation process. We never lose sight of the case at hand, but we place equal importance on working with clients to rectify business issues that underlie the litigation.

## The strength of these client relationships rests upon the structure of our firm.
We're compact, focused and agile. Yet we have a national litigation presence, with the capacity to resolve the largest, most complex legal matters. We leverage technology to serve our clients with the responsiveness of a small firm and the capabilities of a large one. Our leading-edge e-discovery platform reduces discovery costs and timelines while improving accuracy, consistency and automation of the discovery process.

## Our mission remains the same as the day we opened our doors: to practice law at the highest levels and to achieve the best results in court for our clients.
